Before you go on to syncing AirPods to your Mac, you must keep in mind that different AirPods are compatible with different Mac versions:

* First-generation AirPods require macOS Sierra and later versions
* Second-generation AirPods require macOS Mojave 10.14.4 and later versions.
* Third-generation AirPods require macOS Monetary or later versions. 
* AirPods Pro requires macOS Catalina 10.15.1 or a later version.

Assuming version compatibility checks out, there are two ways of connecting AirPods to Macbook, depending on whether you’re already using your AirPods on your iPhone or not.

1. Connecting AirPods to Your Mac if They’re Not Previously Synced to Your iPhone

_The first thing you need to do is make sure that your AirPods are in their charging case and that the case is charged. Once that’s handled, here are the next steps:_

* Make sure to turn on the Bluetooth on your Mac. Then, access System preferences on your Mac device and click on Bluetooth.
* Once you’ve done that, open the lid of the AirPods case and press and hold the button on the back until it flashes white.
* Find the AirPods on the Bluetooth list and click **“Connect”** to finish connecting your AirPods to your Mac.

_Once you connect your AirPods to Mac, you can use them just like any other pair of headphones, including some of the best wireless earbuds currently available on the market._

_You can adjust the volume, play or pause music, and even skip tracks by double-tapping on either AirPod._

2. Connecting AirPods to Your Mac That Is Already Synced With Your iPhone

**_Before pairing AirPods with Macbook, you need to make sure that:_**

* You’re using the same Apple ID both on your Mac and iPhone.
* Check if the Handoff feature on your Mac is turned on by accessing System Preferences and navigating to General to see if there’s a checkmark next to **“Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices”**.
* The volume icon must be visible in the menu bar. If not, go to System Preferences and allow the “Show volume in menu bar” section.

## How to connect your AirPods to a Mac if you don't use them on an iPhone?

_If your AirPods aren't already connected to your iPhone, you can connect them directly to your Mac anyway._

1. With the AirPods in their charging case, open the lid but don't remove the AirPods.
2. Press and hold the button on the back of the case until the status light starts to flash.
3. On your Mac, click the Apple menu and then click **"System Preferences"**.
4. In the System Preferences window, click **"Bluetooth**."
5. In the list of devices, find the AirPods you want to pair with the Mac and then click **"Connect"**.
6. After the connection is complete, the AirPods will appear in the top of the Devices list, ready to be used.


## How to connect your AirPods to your Mac if you already use them on your iPhone?

_Your AirPods are designed to connect to your Mac automatically if the Mac is using the same Apple ID as your iPhone._

**If this is the case:**

1. Open your AirPods case, just like you do to connect them to your iPhone.
2. On your Mac, click the Volume icon in the menu bar at the top of your screen. It looks like a speaker.
3. In the **"Output Device"** section of this menu, select your AirPods.

If this doesn't work, there are a couple of settings you need to ensure are enabled. Open System Preferences by clicking the Apple icon in the menu bar, and then clicking "System Preferences."

* Make sure your Mac is logged into the same Apple ID as your iPhone. In the System Preferences window click **"Apple ID"** to make sure you're signed in and using the same ID as your iPhone.
* Make sure Handoff is turned on. In the System Preferences window, click "General," and make sure there is a check mark next to **"Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices"**.
* If you don't see the volume icon in the menu bar, you need to turn it on. In the System preferences window, click **"Sound"** and then click the checkbox next to **"Show volume in menu bar"**.
